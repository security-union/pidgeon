## What is Pidgeon?

Pidgeon is a high-performance, thread-safe PID controller library written in Rust. Unlike actual pigeons that poop on your freshly washed car, this Pidgeon delivers precisely controlled outputs without any messy side effects.

The name pays homage to history's most battle-tested messengers. In both World Wars, carrier pigeons maintained 98% delivery rates while flying through artillery barrages, poison gas, and enemy lines. Cher Ami, a famous war pidgeon, delivered a critical message despite losing a leg, an eye, and being shot through the chest. Like these feathered veterans, our PID controller is engineered to perform reliably when everything else fails. It might not win the Croix de Guerre like Cher Ami did, but it'll survive your chaotic production environment with the same unflappable determination.

## Why Pidgeon?

Because while Google has advanced AI systems that can recognize cats in YouTube videos, sometimes you just need a reliable PID controller that doesn't require a PhD in machine learning or a fleet of TPUs to operate.

## Features

- **Thread-safe**: Unlike that "concurrent" Java code you wrote during your internship, Pidgeon won't race your conditions.
- **Use case agnostic**: From temperature control to flight stabilization to maintaining optimal coffee-to-code ratios, Pidgeon doesn't judge your control theory applications.
- **Written in Rust**: Memory safety without garbage collection, because who needs garbage when you've got ownership?
- **Minimal dependencies**: Doesn't pull in half of npm or require weekly security patches.

## Quick Start

```rust
use pidgeon::{PidController, ControllerConfig};
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    // Create a PID controller with appropriate gains for temperature control
    let config = ControllerConfig::new()
        .with_kp(2.0)    // Proportional gain
        .with_ki(0.5)    // Integral gain
        .with_kd(1.0)    // Derivative gain
        .with_output_limits(-100.0, 100.0)  // Limit control signal (-100% to 100%)
        .with_anti_windup(true);  // Prevent integral windup

    let controller = PidController::new(config);
    
    // Simulation parameters
    let setpoint = 22.0;  // Target temperature in Celsius
    let simulation_duration = 120;  // Simulation duration in seconds
    let dt = 1.0;  // Time step in seconds
    
    // Initial conditions
    let mut current_temp = 18.0;  // Starting room temperature
    let ambient_temp = 15.0;  // Outside temperature
    let room_thermal_mass = 5000.0;  // J/¬∞C - thermal mass of the room
    let hvac_power = 2000.0;  // W - maximum heating/cooling power
    
    println!("Time(s) | Temperature(¬∞C) | Control Signal(%) | HVAC Mode");
    println!("--------|-----------------|-------------------|----------");
    
    // Simulation loop
    for time in 0..simulation_duration {
        // Calculate control signal (-100% to 100%) using PID controller
        let error = setpoint - current_temp;
        let control_signal = controller.compute(error, dt);
        
        // Determine HVAC mode based on control signal
        let hvac_mode = if control_signal > 5.0 {
            "Heating"
        } else if control_signal < -5.0 {
            "Cooling"
        } else {
            "Idle"
        };
        
        // Apply control signal to the simulated HVAC system
        // Positive = heating, Negative = cooling
        let power_applied = hvac_power * control_signal / 100.0;
        
        // Simple thermal model of the room
        let thermal_loss = 0.1 * (current_temp - ambient_temp);
        let temperature_change = (power_applied - thermal_loss) * dt / room_thermal_mass;
        
        // Update current temperature
        current_temp += temperature_change;
        
        // Print status
        println!("{:6} | {:15.2} | {:17.1} | {}", 
                 time, current_temp, control_signal, hvac_mode);
        
        // Simulate external disturbance at 60 seconds (someone opens a window)
        if time == 60 {
            current_temp -= 2.0;
            println!(">>> Window opened! Temperature dropped 2¬∞C");
        }
        
        // Slow down simulation to make it observable
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100));
    }
    
    // Check controller statistics
    let stats = controller.get_statistics();
    println!("\nController Statistics:");
    println!("Average error: {:.2}¬∞C", stats.average_error);
    println!("Max overshoot: {:.2}¬∞C", stats.max_overshoot);
    println!("Settling time: {:.1} seconds", stats.settling_time);
}
```

For thread-safe operation in a real HVAC system with multiple sensors:

```rust
use pidgeon::{ThreadSafePidController, ControllerConfig};
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    // Create a thread-safe PID controller that can be shared across threads
    let config = ControllerConfig::new()
        .with_kp(2.0)
        .with_ki(0.5)
        .with_kd(1.0);
    
    let controller = Arc::new(ThreadSafePidController::new(config));
    
    // Clone controller for use in sensor thread
    let sensor_controller = Arc::clone(&controller);
    
    // Sensor thread continuously reads temperature and updates the controller
    let sensor_thread = thread::spawn(move || {
        let mut prev_temp = read_temperature_sensor();
        
        loop {
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)); // Read every 100ms
            let current_temp = read_temperature_sensor();
            let setpoint = 22.0;
            let error = setpoint - current_temp;
            
            // Calculate dt (time since last measurement)
            let dt = 0.1; // 100ms in seconds
            
            // Update controller with new error measurement
            sensor_controller.update_error(error, dt);
            
            prev_temp = current_temp;
        }
    });
    
    // Control thread applies the PID output to the HVAC system
    let control_thread = thread::spawn(move || {
        loop {
            // Get the latest control signal from the controller
            let control_signal = controller.get_control_signal();
            
            // Apply to HVAC system
            if control_signal > 5.0 {
                activate_heating(control_signal);
            } else if control_signal < -5.0 {
                activate_cooling(-control_signal);
            } else {
                idle_hvac_system();
            }
            
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500)); // Control loop runs at 2Hz
        }
    });
    
    // Wait for threads to complete (they won't in this example)
    sensor_thread.join().unwrap();
    control_thread.join().unwrap();
}

// Mock functions for the example
fn read_temperature_sensor() -> f64 { /* Read from actual sensor */ 21.5 }
fn activate_heating(power_percent: f64) { /* Control heating element */ }
fn activate_cooling(power_percent: f64) { /* Control cooling system */ }
fn idle_hvac_system() { /* Set HVAC to idle state */ }
```

## FAQ

**Q: Is this better than the PID controller I wrote in my CS controls class?**  
**A:** Yes, unless you're that one person who actually understood eigenvalues.

**Q: Can I use this in production?**  
**A:** You could, but maybe don't control nuclear reactors with it just yet.

**Q: Why is it called Pidgeon?**  
**A:** Because "CarrierPidgeon" was too long, and like the bird, this library delivers... but with better spelling.

## Performance Benchmarks

Pidgeon is designed for high-performance control applications. Below are benchmark results showing how the library performs in different scenarios:

| Benchmark               | Time (ns)       | Operations/sec | Description                                                        |
|-------------------------|-----------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `pid_compute`           | 394.23 ns       | 2,536,590/s    | Single-threaded PID controller processing 100 consecutive updates |
| `thread_safe_pid_compute` | 673.21 ns     | 1,485,420/s    | Thread-safe PID controller without concurrent access               |
| `multi_threaded_pid`    | 26,144 ns       | 38,250/s       | Concurrent access with one thread updating and another reading     |

### What Each Benchmark Measures

1. **pid_compute**:
   - Tests the raw performance of the non-thread-safe `PidController`
   - Represents the absolute fastest performance possible
   - Ideal for single-threaded applications or embedded systems with limited resources

2. **thread_safe_pid_compute**:
   - Measures the overhead introduced by the thread-safe wrapper
   - Uses the `ThreadSafePidController` but without actual concurrent access
   - Approximately 70% slower than the non-thread-safe version due to mutex overhead
   - Provides a good balance of safety and performance for most applications

3. **multi_threaded_pid**:
   - Simulates a real-world scenario with concurrent access
   - One thread continuously updates the controller with new errors
   - Another thread reads the control signal in parallel
   - Demonstrates thread contention effects in a realistic use case

These benchmarks show that while thread-safety introduces some overhead, Pidgeon remains highly efficient for real-time control applications. A single controller can comfortably handle update rates of 1 MHz in single-threaded mode or 30-40 kHz in a heavily multi-threaded environment.

### Running Benchmarks

To run these benchmarks yourself:

```bash
cargo bench --package pidgeon --features benchmarks
```

## Demo Application: `run_pidgeon_demo.sh`

Experience Pidgeon in action with our comprehensive demo application! The `run_pidgeon_demo.sh` script launches a complete demonstration environment:

```bash
./run_pidgeon_demo.sh
```

This script starts:
1. **Pidgeoneer Leptos Web Server** - A beautiful web dashboard running on port 3000
2. **Temperature Control PID Demo** - A real-time example showing PID control in action

The demo provides:
- Real-time visualization of temperature control
- Live updates of PID controller parameters
- Performance metrics and response curves
- Interactive dashboard for monitoring controller behavior

The web-based interface allows you to observe the PID controller's performance as it manages temperature control, with live graphs showing setpoint, actual temperature, and control signals.

```bash
# After starting the demo:
# 1. The script launches the Pidgeoneer web server
# 2. Opens your browser to http://localhost:3000
# 3. Waits for you to press 'S' to start the actual PID controller
# 4. Press Ctrl+C when you're done to clean up all processes
```

## Debugging Features

Why spend hours with printf debugging when Pidgeon can tell you exactly what's going wrong? Our advanced debugging features turn PID tuning from black magic into actual engineering:

- **Automatic Gain Suggestion**: Pidgeon analyzes your system's response and suggests improved PID gains
- **Stability Analysis**: Get warnings when your configuration might lead to instability
- **Performance Metrics**: Real-time calculation of rise time, settling time, overshoot, and steady-state error
- **Response Visualization**: Export control data to view beautiful Bode plots without leaving your terminal
- **Gain Scheduling Detection**: Automatically detects when your system would benefit from gain scheduling

Enable debugging by adding the `debugging` feature to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
# In your Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
pidgeon = { version = "1.0", features = ["debugging"] }
```

Then configure your controller with the debugging capabilities:

```rust
use pidgeon::{ControllerConfig, ThreadSafePidController, DebugConfig};

// Create your controller configuration
let config = ControllerConfig::new()
    .with_kp(2.0)
    .with_ki(0.1)
    .with_kd(0.5)
    .with_output_limits(-100.0, 100.0)
    .with_anti_windup(true)
    .with_setpoint(22.0);

// Create debug configuration to stream data to Iggy
let debug_config = DebugConfig {
    iggy_url: "127.0.0.1:8090".to_string(),
    stream_name: "pidgeon_debug".to_string(),
    topic_name: "controller_data".to_string(),
    controller_id: "temperature_controller".to_string(),
    sample_rate_hz: Some(10.0), // 10Hz sample rate
};

// Create controller with debugging enabled
let controller = ThreadSafePidController::new(config)
    .with_debugging(debug_config)
    .expect("Failed to initialize controller with debugging");

// Your controller is now streaming debug data to Iggy
// which can be visualized in real-time using Pidgeoneer!
```

When you run the application, all controller data is streamed to the configured Iggy server, where it can be visualized and analyzed in real-time through the Pidgeoneer dashboard. This gives you unprecedented visibility into your controller's behavior without compromising performance.

## Real-time Diagnostics with Iggy.rs

In production environments, monitoring your PID controllers is just as critical as tuning them properly. That's why Pidgeon integrates with [Iggy.rs](https://iggy.rs) - the blazing-fast, rock-solid streaming platform built in Rust.

### Why We Stream Diagnostic Data

Traditional logging methods fall short for real-time control systems:
- Log files become unwieldy for high-frequency control data
- In-memory buffers risk data loss during crashes
- Debugging becomes a post-mortem activity instead of real-time observability

### Enter Iggy.rs

Iggy.rs provides the perfect solution for streaming controller telemetry:

### What Gets Streamed

Every aspect of your controller's performance is captured in real-time:
- Raw control signals, setpoints, and process variables
- Derivative and integral components
- Timing information (execution time, jitter)
- System response characteristics
- Auto-tuning activities and recommendations

### Why Iggy.rs?

When we evaluated streaming platforms for Pidgeon, Iggy.rs stood out for several reasons:

1. **Performance**: Written in Rust, Iggy delivers blazing-fast throughput with minimal overhead - essential for control systems with microsecond decision loops
2. **Reliability**: Rock-solid design ensures your diagnostic data never gets lost, even during system disruptions
3. **Scalability**: From a single embedded controller to thousands of distributed control nodes, Iggy scales effortlessly
4. **Rust Native**: No FFI overhead or serialization bottlenecks - seamless integration with our codebase
5. **Stream Processing**: Analyze control behavior in real-time with Iggy's powerful stream processing capabilities
6. **Ecosystem**: Growing community with excellent tools for visualization and analysis

As the hottest streaming platform in the Rust ecosystem, Iggy was the obvious choice for Pidgeon. When your PID controller is making mission-critical decisions thousands of times per second, you need diagnostics that can keep up.
